	<p>My name is Elena Villalobos and I work in the <a class='link' href="http://bouzaslab25.com/">Lab25</a> with Dr Arturo Bouzas, I'm interested in Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences. Inquiring the variables that make certain behaviours more likely, is my general interest, and how this knowledge could be applied to socially important problems. Specifically I study how people make decisions when time and probability are involved in the available alternatives. I'm also pretty interested in Bayesian Cognitive Modeling.  </p>
