	<p>My name is Elena Villalobos and I work in the <a class='link' href="http://bouzaslab25.com/">Lab25</a> with Dr Arturo Bouzas. I did my BA (Hons) in Psychology at National Autonomous University of Mexico. </p>
	
	<p>My general interest is to inquire the variables that make certain behaviours more likely, and how this knowledge could be applied to socially relevant problems. </p>
	
	<p>I study how people make decisions when time and probability are involved in the available alternatives, specifically, Intertemporal and Risky choices. Besides, I'm interested in looking for the mathematical models that can describe better these choices, analysing family models such as attribute and alternatives choice rules. </p>
	
	<p>Furthermore, I study Bayesian Cognitive Modeling and I agree with the idea of analyzing raw data before any statistical analysis. Some other topics that I've studied are Procrastination and Risky Behaviours.</p>
